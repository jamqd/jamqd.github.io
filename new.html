                        I am a first-year computer science student at UCLA. I am originally from San Jose, CA where 
                        I recently graduated from Evergreen Valley High School. Beyond my studies, I am passionate about 
                        Artificial Intelligence and its applications. I spend most of my time working on   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I am a deep learning engineer (and one of the first batch of five non-founding employees) at <a href="https://sikeinsights.com/">Sike AI</a>. 
                        Sike is an enterprise software company that 
                        I work on developing the deep learning systems for personality trait extraction from text, video, and audio. This enables our 
                        software to help companies instantaneously 
                        We are backed by <!---Kleiner Perkins and --> the Anderson Venture Accelerator.

                        I am also a research intern at the <a href="https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/">Center for Vision Cognition Learning and Autonomy (VCLA)</a> 
                        where I work on researching casual learning and reinforcement learning. Currently, I am working on developing 
                        <a href="https://xuxie1031.github.io/projects/VRGym/VRGymProj.html">VRGym</a>,
                        a platform for physical and interactive AI/robotics research.
                        I collaborate with <a href="http://www.mjedmonds.com/">Mark Edmonds</a> and <a href="https://xuxie1031.github.io/">Xu Xie</a>.

                        Recently, I was a machine learning researcher at the <a href="https://org.ee.ucla.edu/">Ozcan Research Group</a> where I worked on developing 
                        a deep learning system for fast and accurate diagnosis of diseases on mobile embedded devices. A poster of our work that I presented can 
                        be found <a href="#">here</a>.

                        I am also an AI  Officer at <a href="http://www.uclaacm.com/">UCLA's Association for Computing Machinery Chapter</a>
                         where I work on leading a team of UCLA students to work on machine learning projects. I am also the lead project manager
                         at <a href="https://datares.github.io/">DataRes</a>, a new data science organization at UCLA.

                    <p>
                        In my very limited free time, I enjoy playing guitar, going to the gym, singing, and watching stand-up comedy.
